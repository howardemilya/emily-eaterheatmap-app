# emily-eaterheatmap-app
CLI Portfolio Project


For this project, people will be able to find the latest restaurants to make the "Hottest Restaurants" list according to Eater in whichever city they choose.

The application will greet the user, list the cities that are available to choose from and then request user input as to which city they want. After that, a list of the hottest restaurants for that city will appear and the user will be asked which restaurant they would like details on. It will take that user's input and return the restaurant's location and a short description. The program will loop until the user chooses to "exit."
